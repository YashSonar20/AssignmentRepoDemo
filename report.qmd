# AI Applied to Requirements Definition

## Introduction

In software engineering, a requirement is a condition or capability that a system must meet to satisfy a user's need or business objective. Requirements are the foundation of a successful software project because they ensure that the right product is built from the beginning and improve communication and collaboration among team members. 

When applied to requirements definition, AI can significantly enhance the process by automating tasks like gathering information from various sources, analyzing data to identify patterns and inconsistencies, prioritizing requirements based on business value, and generating clear, structured documentation, ultimately leading to more comprehensive and accurate requirements gathering with less manual effort. 

# (Research; academic papers, case studies, sources, real-world examples where AI is applied in software engineering)

## Explain core concepts of AI related to the topic
## Demonstrate how AI is applied in software engineering; practical applications
## Provide real-world examples, case studies, or practical applications
## Engage audience w/ visuals & examples 


Your research should address how AI can be used to define requirements in the software development process.

Please provide the following sections in your report:

1. Introduction about using AI in requirement definition

2. State-of-the-art research AI tools in requirements definition.

3. Choose three tools and compare them their strengths and weaknesses.

4. Look at emerging tools as well.
