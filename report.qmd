## Introduction

In software engineering, a requirement is a condition or capability that a system must meet to satisfy a user's need or business objective. Requirements are the foundation of a successful software project because they ensure that the right product is built from the beginning and improve communication and collaboration among team members. 

The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the software development process is transforming how requirements are defined, analyzed, and managed. Traditionally, defining requirements has been a labor-intensive and error-prone task requiring continuous stakeholder engagement, documentation review, and validation. AI technologies, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and Predictive Analytics, can automate and enhance these processes, ensuring greater accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability.

By leveraging AI, organizations can improve the quality of requirements, reduce ambiguities, and ensure alignment with evolving business needs. Furthermore, AI-driven tools enable automated traceability, predictive requirement prioritization, and the ability to manage changing requirements dynamically.

This report will explore the latest AI tools used in requirement definition, compare three prominent tools, and discuss emerging AI technologies that promise to further revolutionize the requirement engineering process.

## State-of-the-Art Research AI Tools in Requirements Definition

Several state-of-the-art AI tools and technologies have been developed to assist in defining and managing software requirements. These tools focus on various aspects of the requirement lifecycle, from gathering and classifying requirements to ensuring consistency and traceability. 
Here are some of the leading AI tools utilized in requirements definition:

1. Aqua

2. Notion

3. Visure Solutions

4. IBM Engineering Requirements Quality Assistant (RQA)

5. Copilot

## Comparing AI Tools: Strengths & Weaknesses

## Case Study: Using AI for Requirements Analysis

## Emerging Tools

Tools such as Self healing software are used to minimize reactive fixes in the workplace due to being able to modify requirements based on "real-time system performance" and anomalies that are detected in the system.

Another example of an AI tool that would be beneficial in the workplace is NLP(Natural language processing). The tool is designed to increase efficiency in the workplace by emphasizing and refining requirements from unstructured text such as emails, user feedback or meeting notes. Ideally, it would identify ambiguities, redundancies, and missing elements in requirement documents.

IBM's "Engineering Requirements Management DOORS (Dynamic Object-Oriented Requirements System)" is another AI-powered tool that can significantly enhance the requirements management process. DOORS uses AI to "improve the quality of engineering requirements as they are written, while also optimizing communication and collaboration among teams and stakeholders (taken from https://www.ibm.com/products/requirements-management)."

There are a number of general tools, such as GPT-4, conversational AI tools that systems can integrate for a user to interact with on a home page, self-healing frameworks as mentioned before, and AI-Augmented testing for requirement validation. GPT-4 can  reduce the time and effort required to draft and review requirements, conversational AI tools can let users interact with AI systems through integrated home page systems, creating a better environment for users to interact with a system, and AI-augmented testing tools can use MLA(Machine Learning Algorithms) to simulate different developmental scenarios to test requirement checks before coding begins, which could cut down development time by removing human checks for a step of a process.
