# AI Applied to Requirements Definition

## Introduction

In software engineering, a requirement is a condition or capability that a system must meet to satisfy a user's need or business objective. Requirements are the foundation of a successful software project because they ensure that the right product is built from the beginning and improve communication and collaboration among team members. 

The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the software development process is transforming how requirements are defined, analyzed, and managed. Traditionally, defining requirements has been a labor-intensive and error-prone task requiring continuous stakeholder engagement, documentation review, and validation. AI technologies, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and Predictive Analytics, can automate and enhance these processes, ensuring greater accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability.

By leveraging AI, organizations can improve the quality of requirements, reduce ambiguities, and ensure alignment with evolving business needs. Furthermore, AI-driven tools enable automated traceability, predictive requirement prioritization, and the ability to manage changing requirements dynamically.

This report will explore the latest AI tools used in requirement definition, compare three prominent tools, and discuss emerging AI technologies that promise to further revolutionize the requirement engineering process.

# (Research; academic papers, case studies, sources, real-world examples where AI is applied in software engineering)

## Explain core concepts of AI related to the topic
